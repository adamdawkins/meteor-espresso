# We're going to start by using sacha:autorouter, which automatically creates
# routes for us. This file is here for when we outgrow autorouter and need some
# routes of our own.
# Autorouter maps '/' to a template named `home`
#
# /templateName will look for a template named `templateName` 
# (e.g. /about will display the `about` template.)
#
# /collectionName
#
# If the route segment happens to be the name of a collection,
# the package will additionally set the data context of the route,
# using an object of the same name as the collection.
#
# So if you have a collection named posts 
# (as in Posts = new Mongo.Collection("posts")),
# the context for the route /posts will be set to:
#
# {
#   posts: Posts.find()
# }

Router.configure
