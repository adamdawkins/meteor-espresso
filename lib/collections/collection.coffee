# This file is a template of an example Posts collection using
# Collection2 and Autoform. You can reuse in and get started quickly by replacing "Post" with your collection name 
# (and "Posts" with the plural, for those of you with a Cacti collection)
#
# We define global Collections and Schemas objects at the start
# for use in the client (see /client/helpers.coffee)
#
# Define them in each collection file avoids load order issues
#
@Collections = @Collections || {}
@Schemas = @Schemas ||  {}
#
# Setup the Mongo Collection
# @Posts = Collections.Posts = new Mongo.Collection 'posts'

# Setup the Schema (singular)

# Schemas.Post = new SimpleSchema(
#   title:
#     type: String
#   body:
#     type: String
#     autoform: afFieldInput: type: "textarea"
# )
#
# Attach the Schema to the Collection
# @Posts.attachSchema(Schemas.Post)
